This program will load an existing text file and display the companies in the GUI.
If there is not text file containing companies it will create it and populate it
with the companies that the user enters.
However when re-ran again it will display them and override this companies and the
previous list will not exist. should the user wish to keep the previous list s/he
will need to copy the list to a different directory.
